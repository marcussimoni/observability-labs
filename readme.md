## ðŸ§ª Microservices & Observability Lab

This project is a sandbox environment created to study, experiment, and demonstrate modern observability practices within a microservices architecture.
It brings together multiple Spring Bootâ€“based microservices and a complete observability stack â€” including Grafana, Prometheus, Tempo, Loki, and Jaeger â€” to simulate a realistic production ecosystem.
The environment is fully containerized with Docker Compose, and each microservice is instrumented using OpenTelemetry (OTEL) agents and Prometheus for collecting and exporting traces, metrics, and logs.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals

This lab serves as a foundation for exploring:
	â€¢	Microservices communication patterns (REST, messaging with RabbitMQ, etc.)
	â€¢	Distributed tracing and metrics correlation
	â€¢	Resilience, monitoring, and alerting
	â€¢	Software architecture approaches

## ðŸš€ Overview

In short, this project provides a **hands-on learning platform** to explore how observability integrates with real-world microservice systems. It is **not a production-ready solution**; instead, it serves as a **base project** that can be used to study and experiment with topics relevant to environments similar to those found in a professional setting.

## Pre-requisites

Before running the project, make sure you have installed:

- **Java 21** (required only to execute applications in IDE)  
- **Docker** (to run applications and infrastructure services)


## Running the Project

All applications and infrastructure services are designed to run using Docker Compose. Inside ***infrastructure*** folder execute to build the Java applications and start all application using docker-compose:

```bash
sh start.up build
```

The build attribute is necessary to build the microservices applications. After the images were built execute:

```bash
sh start.up
```

To stop all applications execute the following script:
```bash
sh stop.sh
```

## Generating metrics

After start the environment with ***docker-compose up*** or the ***start.sh*** you can run a k6 script to start to fill the metrics in the applications. This proccess take some minutes. The configurations to k6 are in ***docker-compose-test.yaml*** file. To run k6 execute the following command inside ***infrastructure*** folder.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-test.yaml up
```

## Accessing the Applications

Once the containers are running, you can access the services and monitoring tools throught the Dashboard application: http://localhost/dashboard.

## Visualizing the metrics in Grafana and Jaeger

### Logs, metrics and trances in Grafana.

All dashboards imported in Grafana are from the https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/ site.
